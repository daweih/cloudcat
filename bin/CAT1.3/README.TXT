CAT (Composition Analysis Toolkit) is a software package that includes a novel measure 
of codon usage bias-Codon Deviation Coefficient (CDC). Unlike previous measures, CDC 
effectively accounts for background nucleotide composition in estimating codon usage 
bias and utilizes a bootstrap assessment of the statistical significance of codon usage 
bias.
